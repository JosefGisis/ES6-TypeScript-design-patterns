/**
 * The interpreter pattern is used to interpret the grammar for a simple
 * language. The language is defined by an object structure (this is the reason the grammar for
 * the language needs to be very simple; otherwise, the object inheritance tree would become
 * unmanageably large) and a parser goes through the expression and interprets it.
 *
 * Because this example requires a larger setup than the other examples, it is split into multiple files
 * and is contained in the SOLID directory of this project. See /src/SOLID/interpreter.
